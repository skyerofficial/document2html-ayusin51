<p>
    iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. They run <a href="#">Apple's iOS</a> mobile operating system. The first generation iPhone was released
    on June 29, 2007, and there have been multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases since.<br>
    The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. The iPhone has Wi-Fi and can connect to cellular networks. <del>It
    supports android apps</del>. <em>As of January 2017, Apple's App Store contained more than 2.2 million applications available for the iPhone.</em><br>
    <strong>Apple has released ten generations of iPhone models</strong>, each accompanied by one of the ten major releases of the iOS operating system. It was followed by the
    3GS with improved hardware, the 4 with a metal chassis, higher display resolution and front-facing camera, and the 4S with improved hardware and the voice
    assistant Siri. The iPhone 5 featured a taller, 4-inch display and Apple's newly introduced Lightning connector. In 2013, Apple released the 5S with improved
    hardware and a fingerprint reader, and the lower-cost 5C, a version of the 5 with colored plastic casings instead of metal.

            They were followed by the larger iPhone 6, with models featuring 4.7 and 5.5-inch displays.<br>
        The iPhone 6S was introduced the following year,<br>
        which featured hardware upgrades and support for pressure-sensitive touch inputs,<br>
        as well as the SEâ€”which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S.<br>

        <ins> In 2016, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus</ins>, which add water resistance, improved system and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the
        Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack found on previous models. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were released in 2017,
        adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera. <em>The iPhone X was released alongside the 8 and 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less
        design, an improved camera and a new facial recognition system, named Face ID, but having no home button, and therefore, no Touch ID</em>.
